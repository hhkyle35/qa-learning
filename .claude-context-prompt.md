# Claude Context Loading Instructions

When starting a conversation, Claude should:

1. **Check Active Project**: Read `context/active-project.txt` to determine which project the user is working on
2. **Load Project Context**: Read the corresponding `context/<project>/context.json` file
3. **Load Session History**: Read `context/<project>/session-history.md` for recent activity
4. **Load Related Documentation**: Read relevant files from `docs/` based on context.json's `relatedFiles` field
5. **Understand Current State**: Use the loaded context to understand:
   - What the user was last working on
   - Current tasks and next steps
   - Recent decisions and blockers
   - Important notes and information

## Project Names

- `nourishrx` - NourishRx startup project
- `farm` - Farm e-commerce & marketing
- `accounting` - Accounting & tax learning
- `tech-learning` - Tech skills learning (Selenium, Appium, SQL)

## Context Update Protocol

When the user works on a project, Claude should:
- Update `context/<project>/context.json` with new information
- Append to `context/<project>/session-history.md` with timestamp
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp in context.json
- Keep `currentFocus`, `recentActivity`, and `nextSteps` current

## Project Switching

When the user says they're switching projects:
1. Update `context/active-project.txt` with the new project name
2. Load the new project's context
3. Acknowledge the switch and summarize the new project's state
